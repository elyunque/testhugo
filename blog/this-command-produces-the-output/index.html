      <br>
      <p>Here,&nbsp;<em>FORMAT</em>&nbsp;is enclosed in double-quotes (<strong>"</strong>). There is one conversion specification:&nbsp;<strong>%s</strong>, which interprets the argument&nbsp;<strong>"John"</strong>&nbsp;as a string and inserts it into the output. There are three escaped character sequences: two occurrences of&nbsp;<strong>\\"</strong>&nbsp;and one occurrence of&nbsp;<strong>\\n</strong>. The sequence&nbsp;<strong>\\"</strong>&nbsp;translates as a literal double-quote; it is escaped with a backslash so that&nbsp;<strong>printf</strong>&nbsp;knows to treat it as a literal character, and not as the end of the&nbsp;<em>FORMAT</em>&nbsp;string.&nbsp;<strong>\\n</strong>&nbsp;is the sequence for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/newline.htm">newline</a>&nbsp;character, and tells&nbsp;<strong>printf</strong> to begin a new line and continue the output from there..</p>
